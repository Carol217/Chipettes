###### Things to do
######
 All teammates: consult the Java API entries for queue and deque.

    Draft a prioritized list of deque methods you plan to implement.
    You need not implement every method. (Which are most crucial? Which are most easily implemented?)
    - void addFirst(e)
    - void addLast(e)
    - E removeFirst(e)
    - E removeLast(e)
    - int size()
    - E getFirst()
    - E getLast()

    Write your own local Deque interface.

    Include all methods your trio plans to implement.
    Comment out all methods.

    Collaboratively design an implementation, named as you please, of the deque interface.
    Write your deque implementation.

    Uncomment one method declaration at a time in Deque.java.
    Bring your deque implementation into alignment.
    Lather, rinse, repeat.

    Explain in your README.md, in the root of your teamâ€™s repo,

    Your method selections.
    Your rationale for choosing a (doubly-linked) node-based, array-based, or ArrayList-based architecture.
